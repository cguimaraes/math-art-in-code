# Math Art in Code

This is a collection of Rust programs that generate stunning visual art by implementing mathematical concepts. Each program takes in some parameters and uses them to create an image that reflects the beauty of math.

The repository is meant to serve as a resource for learning Rust and exploring various mathematical ideas. Whether you are new to Rust or an experienced developer, you will find something interesting here. You can use the programs as examples, inspiration, or starting points for your own projects.

The repository includes the following programs (and more):
 - TBD
 
Each program includes a README file that explains the math behind the program, the Rust code used to generate the image, and some example images. You can run the programs on your own computer and experiment with different parameters to generate new images.

Contributions to the repository are welcome! If you have an idea for a program or an improvement to an existing one, feel free to submit an issue or pull request.

Have fun exploring the beauty of math in code!
